The matching each robot finds consists of:
    -A mapping from robots to locations
    -A cardinality (number of robots included in the matching)
    -A total cost

Each robot involved in coordination...

1) finds a matching between each visible robot and its stated alternatives.

2) broadcasts a tuple describing the matching it found.
    For this we use a geometry_msgs::Point32 with X = my ID
                                                  Y = my matching's cardinality
                                                  Z = my matching's cost

3) waits to hear about the matching from all other robots.

Then, from the robots with matching of greatest cardinality, select the ones whose matchings have minimal cost.
From these, the one with the lowest ID number broadcasts its mapping of robots to locations,
while all others wait to receive this mapping.
(Note that the robot broadcasting its mapping is uniquely determined in all circumstances.)

To transmit this mapping, we use a geometry_msgs::Polygon message wherein each Point32 represents the following information:
        X: Where robot N should go (X)
        Y: Where robot N should go (Y)
        Z: N

Do not coordinate with any robot more than once without having changed your grid location.

If a robot decides not to move, wait the time it takes for a robot to move 1 grid space, then resume following path.

Issues for later:
    -What if a robot is not included in the winning matching? What should it do?
    Answer: That robot just shouldn't do anything.

    -Ensure robots are all ready (have received all pending messages) before moving.
